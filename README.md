🔍 Project Overview
This project aims to classify animals into seven biological classes (Mammal, Bird, Reptile, etc.) based only on binary physical and behavioral traits.
✅ Using the XGBoost algorithm, we achieved 100% accuracy on both training and testing datasets.
📱 We also developed a Streamlit web app for real-time, interactive predictions!
This work demonstrates how simple features, when paired with powerful models, can deliver high-impact results in automation and education.

🎯 Problem Statement
How can we predict an animal's class without knowing its name or species?

By leveraging features like milk, feathers, aquatic, and legs, we trained a model to classify animals into one of 7 classes.
This is a multi-class classification problem with overlapping features, making it a great test for machine learning models.
We aimed for a solution that is:

Accurate

Interpretable

Lightweight

Deployable

📊 Dataset Details
✅ Attribute	📌 Description
hair	Whether the animal has hair (0/1)
feathers	Whether it has feathers (0/1)
eggs	Does it lay eggs? (0/1)
aquatic	Can it live in water? (0/1)
milk	Does it produce milk? (0/1)
legs	Number of legs (0–8)
class_type	Target variable (1 to 7)

🗂 Dataset: Zoo Dataset – UCI

📏 Samples: 101 animals

🧪 Features: 16 binary traits

🎯 Target: class_type (Mammal, Bird, Reptile, etc.)

⚙️ Project Workflow
🔽 Here's the complete end-to-end pipeline:

Data Cleaning: Dropped animal_name, no missing values to impute

EDA: Visualized feature correlations & class distribution

Preprocessing: All features were binary — no encoding needed

Model Selection: Tried multiple models for comparison

Training: Hyperparameter tuning using XGBoost

Evaluation: CV, confusion matrix, ROC

Deployment: Streamlit app built for real-time predictions

🤖 Model Selection
🧠 Algorithm	🎯 Accuracy
Decision Tree	100%
Random Forest	97%
Logistic Regression	97%
SVM	94%
K-Nearest Neighbors	91%
✅ XGBoost	100%

🚀 Why XGBoost?

Outperforms all other models

Excellent generalization with regularization

Handles small data & multiclass problems

Fast, scalable, and robust

🧪 Evaluation Metrics
✅ We didn’t just rely on accuracy — here’s how we validated the model:

🔍 Accuracy: 100% on training and testing sets

✅ Cross-Validation: 5-Fold CV and Stratified CV confirmed reliability

📉 Confusion Matrix: All predictions correct, zero misclassification

📈 ROC AUC Score: ~1.0 for all class types

🔒 No Overfitting: Thanks to XGBoost's regularization

🚀 Deployment
🖥️ Built a real-time, interactive app using Streamlit that allows users to:

✔ Select binary traits (milk, feathers, etc.) using checkboxes

✔ Instantly predict the animal's class

✔ Use from browser without coding knowledge
